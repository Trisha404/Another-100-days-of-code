Today's Progress: Intro to Python

Thoughts: I've completed #100DaysofCode in Python before. I plan to revisit some of my old projects to update them and take on some new projects.  I am not completely new to coding. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the past, but I am by no means an expert and would class myself as a 'false beginner'.
