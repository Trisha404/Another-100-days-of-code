# Another-100-days-of-code

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
November 1st 2022

## I Will...
1. Tweet regular progress updates -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code/support with code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub on a regular basis so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. 

## Ideas to Make This Challenge More Effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that I will add links to my progress in the log. 
2. If I get upset or stuck, I'll read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
